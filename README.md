**Create analytics-ready data that fuels artificial intelligence and business intelligence**

## What is this book about?
Delta helps you generate reliable insights at scale and simplifies architecture around data pipelines, allowing you to focus primarily on refining the use cases being worked on. This is especially important when you consider that existing architecture is frequently reused for new use cases

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore the key challenges of traditional data lakes
* Appreciate the unique features of Delta that come out of the box
* Address reliability, performance, and governance concerns using Delta
* Analyze the open data format for an extensible and pluggable architecture
* Handle multiple use cases to support BI, AI, streaming, and data discovery
* Discover how common data and machine learning design patterns are executed on Delta
* Build and deploy data and machine learning pipelines at scale using Delta

All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM some _ parquet _ table
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Data engineers, data scientists, ML practitioners, BI analysts, or anyone in the data domain working with big data will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to executing pipelines and supporting diverse use cases using the Delta protocol. Basic knowledge of SQL, Python programming, and Spark is required to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).

### Software and Hardware List


Basic knowledge of SQL, Python programming, and Spark is required to get the most
out of this book. Delta is open source and can be run both on-prem and in the cloud.
Because of the rise in cloud data platforms, a lot of the descriptions and examples are in
the context of cloud storage.
Use the following GitHub link for the Delta Lake documentation and quickstart guide
to help you set up your environment and become familiar with the necessary APIs:
https://github.com/delta-io/delta.
Databricks is the original creator of Delta, which was open sourced to the Linux
Foundation and is supported by a large user community. Examples in this book cover
some Databricks-specific features to provide a complete view of features and capabilities.
Newer features continue to be ported from Databricks to open source Delta. Please refer
to the proposed roadmap for the feature migration details: https://github.com/
delta-io/delta/issues/920.


We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/UI11F).
